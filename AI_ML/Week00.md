# AI Orientation

**Goals** 
- Understand what’s really going in this field, how to adapt bcuz this field is changing very fast.
- Understand how LLMs actually work 
- New trends in AI Engineering 
- How to be up to date, with new things coming everyday


> **Research and Applied AI** = Research + Applied AI
> - Theoritical General AI Questions
> - Research Engg : Intelligence AI
> - Agent Framework

**Things to do** 
- Basic [python.org docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) or [W3School Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- Have a colab account ready [create colab account ](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Look at different models available in the market today, explore them 
- Will try to not keep as much math, if any will be done with intuitions 

**Extras** - Free stuff you can try:

- [Opencode](https://opencode.ai/)
  - Download and Install it locally and try it `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`
  - Read the [docs](https://opencode.ai/docs)
  - Switch the model to `GLM 4.7` a chinese model(Zen), This model is very similar to `Claude Code`

- [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/)


**AI Engineer Role** : `Backend Engg.` + `AI Models, AI Tools, Agents, Vibe Coding`

**PyTorch** vs TensorFlow -> Now Industry has swtiched to PyTorch, so everyone is using Pythorch now.
- Read [PyTorch Docs](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)

**[Koggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)** : A ML Contest platform where big companies organize or host contests and offers bounty.
